//! \brief Class used to input retargetting info when creating a map file.

//! Contains info on how a particular mapped node will get retargeted.  You specify a node that's being retargeted, and then parameters that
//! specify how the node will get retargeted, ie the amount to scale the position and the coordinate space where the node will get scaled.

	LoadSaveRetargetData():absolute(TRUE){};

	// !\brief Deconstructor
	~LoadSaveRetargetData(){}

	// !\brief The name of the node in the scene that's being mapped.  This must be set.
	TSTR currentNodeName;

	//! \brief The name of the incoming node from the animation file that the current node is mapped to. Note that the map file
	//! that uses this information still needs to explicitly map the tracks from the incoming tracks to the current tracks. This
	//! information doesn't override that information, just confirms it.
	TSTR incomingNodeName;
	
	//! \brief  Whether or not the scale attribute will be the absolute scale value or a relative scale value that is then multiplied
	//! by a scale that's calculated from the ratio of the length of specified current linked nodes versus the length of specified incoming linked nodes.
	BOOL absolute;
	
	//! \brief The scale attribute that's used to scale the retargeted position. If absolute is false then it's a relative value that's multiplied by
	//! the ratio of current versus incoming chain lengths.
	Point3 scale; 


	//! \brief The name of the base node whose coordinate space you will scale in.  If the current base node is the same as the current node that's being
	//! being retargeted, then the node will be retargeted relative to it's first position.
	//! Note that if this value isn't set, then the world root node will be this node.
	TSTR currentBase;

	//! \brief The name of the base node whose coordinate space you will scale the incoming node in.  
	//! Note that if this value isn't set, then the world root node will be this node.
	TSTR incomingBase;

	//! \brief The name of the base of the current chain node that will be used to calculate the scale for retargetting when the absolute
	//! value is false. The scale is then the difference in length from the current end chain to it's base versus the incoming end chain
	//! to it's base.
	//! Note that if this value isn't set, then the world root node will be this node.
	TSTR currentBaseChain;

	//! \brief The name of the end chain of the current chain node that the scale will be calculated from.  The length is calculated
	//! by travesing the distances from the end chain to it's parents, down to the base chain node.
	//! Note that if this value isn't set, then the world root node will be this node.
	TSTR currentEndChain;


	//! \brief The name of the base of the incoming chain node that the scale will be calculated from.  
	//! Note that if this value isn't set, then the world root node will be this node.
	TSTR incomingBaseChain;

	//! \brief The name of the end of the incoming chain node that the scale will be calculated from.  The length is calculated
	//! by travesing the distances from the end chain to it's parents, down to the base chain node.
	//! Note that if this value isn't set, then the world root node will be this node.
	TSTR incomingEndChain;


	//! \brief If TRUE the current FK node will retarget internally as a IK chain to a specified node. That way when retargetting FK chains we can
	//! correctly make sure that the end nodes(like feet) will stay planted on the ground relative to the center of mass.
	BOOL FKRetargetingEnabled; 
	
	//! \brief The name of the nodewhere the base of the internal IK chain will end.  So if you weere retargeting a foot node, you would usually specify
	//! this node to be the hip, so that when the foot retargets as the end of an IK chain, the ankle, and knee joints will get recalclated.
	//! Remember you only need to do this for FK nodes when you want them to be constrained relative to another node, usually the\
	//! center of mass.  Note that if this node isn't set, then this sort of retargeting won't occur, even if the FKRetargetingEnabled flag is TRUE.
